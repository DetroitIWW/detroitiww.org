  <ol>
    <li>Quorum: Quorum is only for ensuring that there is enough interest in and approval of online voting to allow it to be used for the year. Quorum is not registration for online voting. The process of calculating quorum are as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>On January 10th, April 10th, July 10th, and October 10th of each year, the Branch Secretary-Treasurer and Administration Committee will create a Loomio poll which will be shared with all members of the GMB over all official GMB communication channels to calculate quarterly quorum. The poll will be open for one week.</li>
        <li>This poll will include a question asking the member whether they intend to participate in online voting for the GMB for that year.</li>
        <li>If the member answers in the affirmative, they will be recorded as an online quorum member for that year.</li>
        <li>Should the member answer in the negative or provide no response to the poll by the deadline, they will be not be considered an online quorum member for that year.</li>

        <li>Members of the GMB may amend the proposal at the discretion of the initial member who proposed it. If a proposal is amended, the final vote shall be on the amended version of the language as it stands once the discussion period is concluded.</li>
        <li>During the discussion period, alternative proposals on the same topic may be added for consideration by a seconded motion in an official GMB communication channel.
