<p>
Whereas, the Industrial Workers of World have a longstanding tradition of organizing with immigrant workers; and<br><br>

Whereas, the Industrial Workers of the World New York City General Membership Branch has an active campaign in support of workers impacted by a workplace audit executed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and<br><br>

Whereas, the actions of ICE target the most vulnerable of the working class, splitting up families and incarcerating workers for trying to make a better life for themselves; and<br><br>

Whereas, ICE drives down the wages and working conditions of immigrant workers, attempts to pit immigrant and non-immigrant workers against each other, and is an obstacle to the progress of all working people; and<br><br>

Whereas, in New York City, ICE retaliated against protestors occupying the ICE Processing Center at 201 Varick Street by refusing to hold bond hearings for detainees or allow access to pro bono legal representation on June 26 and June 27, 2018; and<br><br>

Whereas, an injury to one is an injury to all; be it,<br><br>

Resolved, that the Industrial Workers of the World New York City General Membership Branch endorses the ICE facility occupations in New York City; and<br><br>

Resolved, that the Industrial Workers of the World New York City General Membership Branch demands the abolition of ICE and a return to open borders; and<br><br>

Resolved, that the Industrial Workers of the World New York City General Membership Branch opposes all cooperation between ICE and the New York City Police Department; and<br><br>

Resolved, that the Industrial Workers of the World New York City General Membership Branch will give material assistance to anti-ICE protests, civil disobedience, and other actions as we are able.
