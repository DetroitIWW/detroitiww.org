<h3>IN CASE YOU MISSED IT</h3>

<strong>Mike Pesa, a longtime member of the IWW who currently belongs to the Baltimore GMB and previously belonged to the New York City GMB, needs our support.</strong> FW Mike’s wife, Heidi, a former kindergarten teacher, suffered a brain injury, and insurance will not cover the costs of her recovery. <a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/longtime-wobbly-need-solidarity/">Read more about it here</a>, and <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/helping-hands-for-heidi">please donate here</a>.<br><br>

<strong>The Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) is fighting draconian new package restrictions in New York State prisons.</strong> <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/families-forced-pay-basic-items-inmates-article-1.3706046">Read more about it here</a>, and <a href="https://diy.rootsaction.org/petitions/no-package-restrictions-for-nys-prisoners">sign a petition against it here</a>.

<strong>In August, the NYC GDC held a successful fundraiser for J20 defendants (which include quite a few Wobblies), but more support is still needed.</strong> <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/gdc-bail-fund-for-j20/fundraiser/gdcsteeringcommittee">Please donate to the GDC fund for J20 here.</a><br><br>

<h3>ORGANIZING RESOURCES</h3>

<strong>The branch has voted to collect dues online!</strong> This will be rolled out along with a revamped website that a group of FWs have put a ton of work into. Watch the list for the launch!<br><br>

<strong>The GMB is working to account for its assets (social media accounts, finance accounts, etc.) and move ownership to the branch and/or appropriate officers or committees.</strong> Please email <a href="mailto:nyc-iww@wobblycity.org">nyc-iww@wobblycity.org</a> if you currently run or have access to any of the branch’s assets.<br><br>

<strong>The IWW one-pager is officially complete—and it looks great!</strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12024hwCNdMzVaEo6IsBwn5SwIVbyf_TX/view">You can find the document here.</a> Make copies at home, surreptitiously at work, or at a unionized print shop, and distribute to help explain what the IWW is and what we do. Thank you to the Fellow Workers who put so much work into this!<br><br>
