<h3>IN CASE YOU MISSED IT</h3>

<strong>Last the month, the branch co-hosted a panel with Strike Corps and DSA's Service Industry Organizing Group.</strong> The panel focused on organizing in the service industry and featured workers from House of Kava in Brooklyn, Gimme Coffee in Upstate New York, and a Wobbly from Burgerville in Portland. If you could not make it, you can find the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thestrikecorps/videos/1881860838567427/UzpfSTE5MzI0OTYwMzA0MDE5MTA6MjA4MTExNjEyODg3MzIzMg/">video here</a>.<br><br>

<strong>The IWW is holding its national convention in Kansas City, Missouri, this September.</strong> The motions being discussed at the convention have been voted on using Loomio, and our branch delegates are ready to represent us in Kansas City. After the convention, Fellow Workers will vote on motions and national officers. <strong>The voting is done online, and you must sign up for <a href="https://redcard.iww.org/">Red Card</a> in order to vote.</strong><br><br>

<strong>The IWW General Headquarters (GHQ) has created a survey</strong> to gain feedback about the union from fellow workers across the country. You can find the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/IWW2018">survey here</a>.<br><br>
