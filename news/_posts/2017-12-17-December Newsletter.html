<strong>The IWW one-pager is officially complete — and looks great!</strong> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12024hwCNdMzVaEo6IsBwn5SwIVbyf_TX/view">You can find the document here.</a> Make copies at home, surreptitiously at work or at a unionized print shop and distribute to help explain what the IWW is and what we do. Thank you to the Fellow Workers who put so much work into this!<br><br>

<strong>There is a push in the IWW to organize people working in education (K-12 or higher education).</strong> If you work in education and would like to connect with this organizing, please contact FW Jen.<br><br>

In August, the NYC GDC held a successful fundraiser for J20 defendants (which include quite a few Wobblies), but more support is still needed. <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/gdc-bail-fund-for-j20/fundraiser/gdcsteeringcommittee">Please continue to donate to the GDC fund for J20.</a><br><br>
