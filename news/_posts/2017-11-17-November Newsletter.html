<h3>IN CASE YOU MISSED IT</h3>

Last month the NYC GMB co-hosted the book launch of <a href="http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/W/bo27407764.html"><em>Wobblies of the World</em></a>. The event was a huge success, featuring editor Peter Cole and <em>Nation</em> journalist Michelle Chen. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Il.y.a.Jallal/videos/10214582883304976/">Check out the recording on Facebook.</a><br><br>

In August, the NYC GDC held a successful fundraiser for J20 defendants, which include quite a few Wobblies, but more support is still needed. <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/gdc-bail-fund-for-j20/fundraiser/gdcsteeringcommittee"><strong>Please continue to donate to the GDC Bail Fund for J20.</strong></a><br><br>
