Fellow people of Chile! The IWW NYC extends its solidarity and support to your cause! The years-long injustice around education, health-care, pensions, water rights, privatization, and policing have long been felt. Your anger is just and your actions are righteous! Your fellow workers in NYC recognize your fight and condemn the actions of Presidente Piñera, his military, and government.
***¡Viva Chile, viva el pueblo! ¡Amor y solidaridad!***
