<h1>Who we are:</h1>
<ul>
<li>The IWW is a democratic union led by its membership. That means we, the workers, make all decisions and have the final say.</li>
<li>The IWW is organized industrially, rather than by trades, and follows a solidarity unionism model.</li>
<li>The IWW is versatile and uses a wide range of tactics to achieve our goals. We don’t just rely on contracts and NLRB elections; we also use direct action and solidarity to defend individual union members who are not in an NLRB-recognized union shop.</li>
<li>The IWW is open to all workers who do not have the power to hire and fire, regardless of employment status.</li>
<li>Wobblies live by the motto “an injury to one is an injury to all.”</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>What we are not:</h1>
<ul>
<li>The IWW is not linked to any political party or group.</li>
<li>The IWW is not led by high-salary union bosses who cut secret deals with employers behind your back.</li>
<li>The IWW is not stifled by union bureaucracy or top-down leadership.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>Our decision-making model:</h1>
<ul>
<li>We are directly democratic, meaning all members have a say in branch decisions.</li>
<li>At our meetings, we follow a procedure called “Rusty’s Rules.” You can read about it in depth <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/rustys-rules-of-order/">here</a>. You don’t have to know it to participate, but it will help you understand what’s going on at meetings.</li>
</ul>
