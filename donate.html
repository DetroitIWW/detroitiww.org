<p style="text-align:center;">
The Industrial Workers of the World is a democratic, member-run union. The IWW's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/gmb">New York City General Membership Branch</a> is 100-percent staffed with volunteers and uses its membership dues to fund its workplace organizing, which currently includes restaurants, bakeries, and prisons. That said, we could always use a hand paying for legal fees, hardship funds, and other costs necessary to organizing. If you can, please make a one-time or recurring donation below, and share this appeal widely.
