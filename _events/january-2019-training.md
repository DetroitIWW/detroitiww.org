# Agitate! ✩ Educate! ✩ Organize! ✩

Join the IWW for a two day training on workplace organizing! This introductory training thoroughly covers the foundations of organizing on the job, focusing on collective action and building your organizing committee.

While a training alone can't make you an expert organizer, you will have the foundational knowledge to organize your workplace, build your committee, and take on your boss.

Each day spans eight hours, 9am-5pm each day. Breakfast, lunch, and childcare will be provided.

This OT 101 is free to all IWW members, with a suggested donation of $10 for non-members (can be made using the below button), but nobody will be turned away for lack of funds (unless you're a boss, cop, TERF, fascist, etc.). Advanced registration is required for attendance, which can be done [below](#registration).<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" style="text-align:center;">

We're capping the training at 30 attendees. Please come to both days if you register. If you can only make one day, it's better to wait until we can offer a training that fits your schedule. We have an additional OT 101 scheduled for March 14-15, and are hoping to do these as frequently as we can, and offer more nuanced versions of the trainings in the future to accommodate different availabilities and workplaces.

If you need childcare, please let us know in the registration [form below](#registration).

While the space is not fully accessible, it can accommodate most accessibility needs with advanced notice. Please detail what accessiblity needs you have in the registration [form below](#registration).
