Our monthly business meetings are a space where we hear report backs from our campaigns and for our membership to make decisions on the organizing and broader work we’re doing in the city. The IWW Detroit GMB meets on the fourth Wednesday of each month for general business meetings. These meetings currently take place over zoom conference call. Contact the branch for details.

We ask for new members and folks curious in the union to meet with a delegate before attending a monthly business meeting. Email us at [detroit@iww.org](mailto:detroit@iww.org) and we’ll connect you with an IWW delegate who you can meet with one-on-one!

Interested in joining? Join online or in-person with a delegate.

We use Rusty’s Rules at our business meeting.

Email detroit@iww.org for location details.
