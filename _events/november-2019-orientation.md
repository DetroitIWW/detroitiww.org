# ★ SO YOU WANNA BE A WOBBLY? ★

Do you work in an industry? Then you are an industrial worker — and you belong in the Industrial Workers of the World!

Join the IWW New York City General Membership Branch for an orientation, potluck*, and social!

**WHERE:** 60 Wall Street POPS (look for an IWW flag)

**WHEN:** Tuesday, November 5th, at 7:30pm

**WHO:** The IWW NYC GMB — and anyone interested in joining or organizing with us!

Agenda:

* 7:30pm: Potluck, Meet & Eat
* 8:15pm: ORIENTATION: Find out what the IWW is all about! We’ll fill you in on all the committees, campaigns and working groups you can join. Delegates will be there, ready to sign up anyone who wants to join on the spot.

Bring some food and join the historic mission of the working class!*

*Can’t bring food? Bring yourself anyway! We’ll make certain there will be enough to go around.
