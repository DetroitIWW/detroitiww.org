# Agitate! ✩ Educate! ✩ Organize! ✩

The coronavirus pandemic is making crystal clear how little employers care about whether workers live or die, particularly low-wage workers of color. Workers are courageously taking their safety and economic security into their own hands and winning important gains. But workplace organizing against powerful corporate adversaries is full of pitfalls that can get in the way of workers winning justice over the long haul.

This training webinar will help you acquire essential workplace organizing fundamentals to win immediate COVID-19 related demands while setting the stage for power that lasts well beyond the crisis.

Training topics include:

1) An organizing approach to COVID-19 mutual aid
2) A strategy making framework for the crisis and for the long-term
3) Tips on centering racial and gender justice in your workplace organizing
4) The role of unions and other worker organizations
5) The legal context of COVID-19 emergency organizing
6) And much more
