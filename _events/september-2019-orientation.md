## "A union is a way to get things done that you can't get done alone."
<br><br>test
On the eighth anniversary of Occupy Wall Street, we'll be hosting a discussion in Tompkins Square Park exploring solidarity unionism — what it means, how it works, and its future.

We'll begin at 7:30pm with a Narcan / Naloxone training to educate folks on how to deal with opioid overdose situations - kits will be provided!

Beginning at 7:50-8pm, we'll have a discussion on solidarity unionism and an orientation on the IWW in NYC. Here are some primers on the subject:
* ["Solidarity Unionism: What it is and what it isn't"](http://organizing.work/2018/09/solidarity-unionism-what-it-is-and-what-it-isnt/) by Don White
* ["A Proposal to American Labor"](https://www.thenation.com/article/proposal-american-labor/) by Joel Rogers and Richard B. Freeman
* ["Solidarity Unionism and Dual Carding: A Primer"](https://www.iww.org/about/solidarityunionism/SolidarityUnionismandDualCardingAPrimer) by Roger Williams

By no means are these readings requirements for the discussion. Bring your curiosity!

**WHERE:** Tompkins Square Park - more specific location details to come. We'll have a flag.

**WHEN:** Tuesday, September 17th, from 7:30 to 9:30pm

**WHO:** The IWW NYC GMB — and anyone interested in joining or organizing with us!
