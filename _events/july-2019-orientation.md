# ★ SO YOU WANT TO BE A WOBBLY? ★

Do you work in an industry? Then you are an industrial worker — and you belong in the Industrial Workers of the World!

Join the IWW New York City General Membership Branch on the High Line for an orientation, potluck*, and social!

**WHERE:** [22nd Street Seating Steps on the High Line](https://www.thehighline.org/garden-zones/23rd-street-lawn/) - W. 22nd St. and Tenth Ave. (wheelchair accessible at 23rd St.)

**WHEN:** Saturday, July 13th, at 3:30pm

**WHO:** The IWW NYC GMB, the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee — and anyone interested in joining or organizing with us!

#### Agenda:

- 3:30pm: Potluck, IWOC Meet & Greet: Get to know outside organizers for the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee and find out how to join the campaign through correspondence and research.
- 4:45pm: ORIENTATION: Find out what the IWW is all about! We’ll fill you in on all the committees, campaigns and working groups you can join. Delegates will be there, ready to sign up anyone who wants to join on the spot.

Bring some food and join the historic mission of the working class!*

*Can’t bring food? Bring yourself anyway! We’ll make certain there will be enough to go around.
